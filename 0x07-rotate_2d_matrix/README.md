This is a Python function  that takes a 2D matrix as input and modifies the matrix in-place by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.

The function, First, gets the length of the matrix (the number of rows or columns) and assigns it to the variable n.
It then transposes the matrix. To transpose a matrix means to swap its rows and columns. The code accomplishes this by iterating over the upper-triangular part of the matrix (i.e., the elements above the diagonal), and swapping each element with its corresponding element across the diagonal. This swaps the row and column indices of each element, effectively transposing the matrix.
Finally, the code reverses each row of the transposed matrix. This has the effect of rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise. It accomplishes this by iterating over each row of the matrix and swapping the elements on either end of the row, then moving inward until it reaches the middle of the row.
